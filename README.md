## About The Project

This personal web developer portfolio was developed as the culmination of my
full stack web development bootcamp at Uplift Code Camp. It showcases the
practical application of the knowledge and skills I acquired during the
intensive six-month program. In addition to the core curriculum, I explored and
integrated additional packages and frameworks like Emailjs, Threejs, Material
UI, and various others. These additions enhanced the project by simplifying the
implementation of certain functionalities.

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- ReactJS
- Material UI
- Threejs
